This repository is simply for small scale practice projects.
Below I will list each project and what it does by language.

Language: C
search.c: A program that will find all instances of a search word from within a file.  All lines are displayed indicating whether the search word is in that line or not.  

lowLetC.c: A program that reads in a string and outputs a total value based on the lowercase letters.  Essentially, lowercase letters are 1-26 correlated with a-z.  For example, if input "aaaaa" would be "1+1+1+1+1" totaling 5.

Language: Python
guess.py : A python CLI random number guessing game.  User tries to guess a number between 1-100.  This idea was inspired by roadmap.sh.  Source: https://roadmap.sh/projects/number-guessing-game  

name.py: A program that has the user input names and randomly selects a name from a list.
